# Homebrew [ShellGPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt) Formula

> [!WARNING]
> This formula is not being updated anymore. The reason is that it has [become difficult to reproduce the exact dependency tree](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-shell_gpt/issues/1/) required for the Homebrew formula. I thought about distributing ShellGPT as a [precompiled binary](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-shell_gpt/tree/binary/), but that took a toll on the app's performance. As a result, I switched to another AI terminal tool.

```sh
$ brew tap vanyauhalin/shell_gpt
$ brew install shell_gpt
```

Feel free to remind me in [issues](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-shell_gpt/issues) to update the formula if I forget.
