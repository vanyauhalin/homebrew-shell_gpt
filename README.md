# Homebrew [ShellGPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt/) Formula

```sh
$ brew tap vanyauhalin/shell_gpt
$ brew install shell_gpt
```

Feel free to remind me in [issues](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-shell_gpt/issues/) to update the formula if I forget.

## Details

Starting from version 1.1.0, ShellGPT is now distributed as a [precompiled binary](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-shell_gpt/releases/). This was done because it became difficult to reproduce the exact dependency tree needed for the Homebrew formula. By reading the source instructions of the [Build ShellGPT Binary](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-shell_gpt/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml/) action you can learn more about the build process.
